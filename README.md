# ModularJS Examples

Few exmaples and insights about writing Modular Javascript.

Some Rules for Modular Javascript:
* Self Contained Modules
	* Everything to do in my modules is in my Modules
	* No Global Variables
	* If a module manages more than one thing, it should split up.
* Seperation of concerns
* DRY code: (Don't repeat yourself)
* Efficient DOM Usage
